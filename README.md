## About this project

Combines K-Nearest Neighbors and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques with the use of capsules to create a collaborative network of neurons. This project was originially for the project requirement of the Machine Learning graduate level course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). Our team decided to pursue an innovative way to compete in the [Google AI Open Images - Object Detection Track competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track) on Kaggle when it runs again next year. The data sets used in this project are linked in the [Data section](#Data) below.

## Data

### Original Data Sets used:

[Data and Validation sets](https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/open-images-annotated-with-bounding-boxes/) in csv files can be found under the Data tab

[Class Names Data](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html) is located under Meta Data on this page
